<span class="string-highlight">self-immolate</span>
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
<span class="string-highlight">we welcome you with open flames</span>
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
<span class="string-highlight">the sign outside reads:</span>
<span class="string-highlight">WE BURN FOREVER</span>
<span class="string-highlight">THESE FOUR WALLS BELONG TO NO ONE</span>
<span class="string-highlight">ALL SQUATTERS WELCOME</span>
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
<span class="string-highlight">if you spend any time here, you will learn that</span>
<span class="string-highlight">to self-immolate is to close the gap between language and body</span>
<span class="string-highlight">to unite the body (signifier) with the soul (signified)</span>
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
<span class="string-highlight">it is the violent confrontation between the interior and the exterior,</span>
<span class="string-highlight">the private and the public, the subject and the object</span>
<span class="string-highlight">invisible flames made visible</span>
<span class="string-highlight">a literal figurative</span>
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
<span class="string-highlight">radical self-immolation cackles in the face of a representative democracy</span>
<span class="string-highlight">it spits in the mouth of the social</span>
<span class="string-highlight">enacting a supremely felt and distributed effect</span>
<span class="string-highlight">laws? LMFAO (Laughing My Flaming Ass Off)</span>
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
<span class="string-highlight">self-immolation finds its apolitical sister in the clandestine rebellion of the gay bar</span>
<span class="string-highlight">though the burn there is much quieter and much slower</span>
<span class="string-highlight">on Fridays (and Saturdays) we go to Fluid (The Wet Spot) to douse ourselves in alcohol (a combustible)</span>
<span class="string-highlight">our belly on fire, a human molotov cocktail</span>
<span class="string-highlight">we burn without your consent</span>
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
<span class="string-highlight">there we’ll find a history of queer kinship up in flames</span>
<span class="string-highlight">(all history is inflammatory)</span>
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
<span class="string-highlight">remember, this is the self-immolator’s greatest threat: counter-hegemonic ideological reproduction</span>
<span class="string-highlight">a view at the end of the world</span>
<span class="string-highlight">THE FEAR OF NATIONS: a self-immolator who sets themselves on fire, who DIES, but continues to live</span>
<span class="string-highlight">a ghost that possesses the dispossessed</span>
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
<span class="string-highlight">(april 14, 2018</span>
<span class="string-highlight">David Buckel’s ashes mix with the earth</span>
<span class="string-highlight">dust to dust, dirt to dirt)</span>
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
<span class="string-highlight">self-immolation snuffs out the the culturally-situated auto-constituted self</span>
<span class="string-highlight">it is a costly metaphor that only finds meaning in a total commitment to subject-failure in the eyes of the would-be regime</span>
<span class="string-highlight">it is a call to action to the tyrannized and a warning to any totalitarian force so arrogant to think that it has the final say</span>
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
<span class="string-highlight">in this moment as state actors rush to extinguish the flames of a queer on the steps of St. Peter’s Basilica,</span>
<span class="string-highlight">the burning body stands in for purification of the city-state itself, powerless to intervene</span>
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
<span class="string-highlight">for Alfredo Ormando a private shaming precedes a public flaming:</span>
<span class="string-highlight">“if I have to roast in hell, I might as well prepare myself for it”</span>
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
<span class="string-highlight">in anticipation, Alfredo took a DIY approach to self-annihilation</span>
<span class="string-highlight">by cutting himself out of every photo</span>
<span class="string-highlight">“There isn’t a photo left of me, I destroyed all the photos that betrayed me”</span>
<span class="string-highlight">re-presentation is a betrayal when it doesn’t represent</span>
<span class="string-highlight">a faceless inferno of untruth</span>
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
<span class="string-highlight">but we will insist that in this very final act,</span>
<span class="string-highlight">re-presentation is representation</span>
<span class="string-highlight">(as unlikely as it may seem)</span>
<span class="string-highlight">meme-etic miming through rhyming and timing</span>
<span class="string-highlight">who says that we can’t reproduce? Ha(1) Ha(2)!</span>
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
<span class="string-highlight">so when you say “to live is to be, you see?”</span>
<span class="string-highlight">we’ll feign interested blindness</span>
<span class="string-highlight">“thanks but we’ll throw ourself on the pyre”</span>
<span class="string-highlight">just another faggot lost to the fire</span>
